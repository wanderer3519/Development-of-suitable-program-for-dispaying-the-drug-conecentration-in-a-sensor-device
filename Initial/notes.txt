Part ii:
Interface having the place having m and c. (Caliberation)
Excel itself will be given.
Voltage of a specific value is given.
Conc for this value should be outputted.
Excel : Voltage(V), Time(s), Current(mA)

Part iii: Interface
y = mx + c calculation
y : current -> avg of readings from Excel
m , c : Caliberation plot -> ip
 
Blink -> tool like arduino

1. Take readings
2. Sort them for specific value
3. Take avg current 
4. Interface <- avg current as input
5. Showed on Interface
6. y = mx + c calculation
