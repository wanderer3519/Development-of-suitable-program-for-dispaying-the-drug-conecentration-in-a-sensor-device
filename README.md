Progress made:
1. On 12th March 2024, Successfully read the input from an excel file into a python program
2. On 11th April 2024, Successfully read the calibration plot
3. On 11th May 2024, Successfully created a sample webpage and used it to calculate concentration
4. On 14th May 2024, Successfully used the calibration and readings to output the concentration

Naviagte to the branch "final" for the project. The entire work for the project is done there.
After navigating to final and cloning, follow the next instructions to run the program.
