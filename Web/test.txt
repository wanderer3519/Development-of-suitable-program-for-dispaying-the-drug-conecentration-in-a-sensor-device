problem statemtnt

    1 glucometer(potentiostat) - takes a current reading and converts to concentrtion

    issue: will only work with pre set calibration.

    2 ch instrument: labs

    issue input is graph, the sencond software to analyze the graph, to calc slope and intercept

Solution :
     an integration of the above.
     1. analyze caliberation plot for cal slope and y intercept
     2. takes reading of current and calculate the conocetration
